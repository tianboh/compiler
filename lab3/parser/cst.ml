(* L2 Compiler
 * Concrete Syntax Trees
 *
 * Concrete Syntax Tree(CST) is transformed from parser directly.
 * So almost every grammer rule corresponds to a CST type here
 * We have below CST type based on Grammer L2, which is shown in lab2 handout
 * program
 * type
 * decl
 * stmts
 * stmt
 * simp
 * lvalue
 * control
 * exp
 * asop
 * binop
 * unop
 * 
 * We omit below due to
 * block: this will lead to recursive reference between cst type and mly type
 * simpopt: we can handle empty in mly, so don't bother it CST
 * elseopt: same as above
 * intconst: handled in mly
 * postop: handled in mly as binary operation. Though there is a postop type, it is not used
 * It only serves for mly token.

(* Notice that the subexpressions of an expression are marked.
 * (That is, the subexpressions are of type exp Mark.t, not just
 * type exp.) This means that source code location (a src_span) is
 * associated with the subexpression. Currently, the typechecker uses
 * this source location to print more helpful error messages.
 *
 * It's the parser and lexer's job to associate src_span locations with each
 * ast. It's instructive, but not necessary, to closely read the source code
 * for c0_parser.mly, c0_lexer.mll, and parse.ml to get a good idea of how
 * src_spans are created.
 *
 * Check out the Mark module for ways of converting a marked expression into
 * the original expression or to the src_span location. You could also just
 * look at how the typechecker gets the src_span from an expression when it
 * prints error messages.
 *
 * It's completely possible to remove Marks entirely from your compiler, but
 * it will be harder to figure out typechecking errors for later labs.
