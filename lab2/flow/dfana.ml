  This file is used to achieve dataflow analysis.

  We traverse by block to boost the performance. Each block contains information including 
  gen, kill, successor, predecessor, in set and out set. Each block has one entry point and one exit point.
  It may have multiple predecessors and successors though. We use block number 0 and -1 to denote entry and 
  exit block respectively, and there is only one entry and one exit block in the whole program.

  In forward analysis, we can traverse from entry point to exit point using successor field in each
  block. However, in backward analysis, we should traverse using predecessor field. In order to make life
  easier, we swap predecessors and successors in backward analysis. So we can use the same traverse scheme in
  forward and backward by using successor field.

  Though we can use same traverse scheme in dataflow analysis. We still need to calculate gen and kill set for
  each block. The traverse order in each block differs in forward and backward analysis. Therefore, we use 
  logical line concept. Each logical block is composed of several logical lines. Logical lines are normal line
  number order in forward analysis, and reversed in backward analysis. By preprocess logical lines from original
  lines, we can traverse from first logical line to the end logical line without considering forward/backward scenario.

  Traverse every logical lines within the same basic block(BB) using below formula to get gen and kill set for BB.
    gen[BB] <- gen[BB] U gen[s] - kill[s]
    kill[BB] <- kill[BB] U kill[s] - gen[s]

  For forward-may analysis, we calculate by
    in[BB] <- U out[BB'] where BB' are predecessors of BB. out[BB'] are initialized to empty set in the begining.

  For forward-must analysis, we calculate by
    in[BB] <- Intersect out[BB'] where BB' are predecessors of BB. out[BB'] are initialized to full set.

  Since we use logical block, backward is treated as forward, so we ignore its formula here.

  Heuristically speeking, we should use pre-order to traverse logical blocks. However, control flow graph may contain
  circles, so we didn't use this order.
